    "content": "What is DATA?\nData refers to raw facts and figures that have no context or meaning by themselves. It could be numbers, text, images, audio, etc.\nExample:\n101, 'John', 'A+', 90\n\nProperties or Attributes\nAttributes are characteristics or properties that describe an entity.\nExample:\nFor a student entity:\n- Roll No (Integer)\n- Name (String)\n- Grade (Character)\n- Marks (Integer)\n\nDATABASE\nA Database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.\nExample:\nA student database containing records like Roll No, Name, Age, Grade.\n\nDATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS)\nA DBMS is software used to store, retrieve, and manage data in databases. It provides an interface for users to perform operations like insert, update, delete, and query.\nExample:\nMySQL, Oracle, MS Access\n\nRELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)\nAn RDBMS is a type of DBMS that stores data in the form of related tables. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for database access.\nExample:\nMySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle\n\nRELATIONAL MODEL\nThe Relational Model represents data as a collection of relations (tables). Each table has rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). It ensures data integrity, avoids redundancy, and maintains relationships using keys.\n\nRULES OF E.F. CODD\n1. Information Rule: All data should be stored in table format.\n   Example: Student(Name, Age, Grade)\n\n2. Guaranteed Access Rule: Each data element should be accessible via table name, column name, and primary key.\n   Example: SELECT Name FROM Student WHERE ID = 101;\n\n3. Systematic Treatment of NULLs: NULLs must be uniformly treated as missing or inapplicable data.\n   Example: A missing phone number in a record is stored as NULL.\n\n4. Dynamic Online Catalog: Metadata (data about data) should be stored in the same format as regular data.\n   Example: System tables like INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES in SQL Server\n\n5. Comprehensive Data Sub-language Rule: The system must support at least one language (like SQL) that can define, manipulate, and control data.\n   Example: SQL as the comprehensive language.\n\n6. View Updating Rule: All views that are theoretically updatable should be updatable by the system.\n   Example: CREATE VIEW HighScorers AS SELECT Name FROM Student WHERE Marks > 90;\n\n7. High-level Insert, Update, Delete: Operations must be supported for sets of rows.\n   Example: UPDATE Student SET Grade = 'A+' WHERE Marks > 90;\n\n8. Physical Data Independence: Changes in physical storage should not affect how users access data.\n\n9. Logical Data Independence: Changes in logical structure should not affect application programs.\n\n10. Integrity Independence: Integrity constraints must be stored separately and modifiable without affecting applications.\n   Example: Setting a constraint like Marks < 100\n\n11. Distribution Independence: Users should not need to know whether the database is distributed.\n\n12. Non-subversion Rule: Low-level access should not be able to bypass security and integrity rules.",

  "title": "SQL Data Types",
  "content": "SQL Data Types define the type of data that can be stored in a column. Each column in a table must have a name and a data type.\n\n1. Numeric Data Types\n- INT / INTEGER: Whole numbers (e.g., 100, -25)\n- SMALLINT: Smaller range of integers\n- BIGINT: Larger range of integers\n- DECIMAL(p,s) or NUMERIC(p,s): Exact numeric values with precision and scale (e.g., DECIMAL(5,2) â†’ 999.99)\n- FLOAT / REAL / DOUBLE: Approximate floating-point numbers\n\n2. String Data Types\n- CHAR(n): Fixed-length character string (e.g., CHAR(5) stores 'Kishore' as 'Kisho')\n- VARCHAR(n): Variable-length character string (e.g., VARCHAR(50))\n- TEXT: Large text data (may vary by DBMS)\n\n3. Date and Time Data Types\n- DATE: Stores date values (format: YYYY-MM-DD)\n- TIME: Stores time (HH:MM:SS)\n- DATETIME: Stores both date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)\n- TIMESTAMP: Auto-generates current timestamp on insert/update\n\n4. Boolean Data Type\n- BOOLEAN: Stores TRUE or FALSE values (some DBMS use TINYINT 0/1)\n\n5. Binary Data Types\n- BINARY / VARBINARY: Store binary data like images, files, etc.\n- BLOB: Binary Large Object, used for storing large binary data\n\n6. Miscellaneous\n- ENUM: A list of predefined values\n- SET: A collection of predefined values that can be stored together\n\nChoosing the correct data type ensures:\n- Efficient storage\n- Accurate data\n- Better performance",
